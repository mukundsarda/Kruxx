You may need to download pdftotext from https://github.com/oschwartz10612/poppler-windows. Once it's downloaded, extract the files and then go to Environment Variables -> System Variables -> Path -> New and then add the address of 'bin' folder of the newly extracted folder. Then restart the app.

Ensure that you have installed the correct docTR library (python-doctr).
